# Module 12 Employee Tracker

This application allows a user to add to and update a database with information about employees in their company.  They are able to view all departments, roles, and employees, add new departments, roles, and employees, and update the role of any employee.

This application makes use of Inquirer prompts where input is added to a database using MySQL2.  

This was created by Catherine Cunningham with help from boot camp tutoring staff and TAs.

A video walkthrough of the application can be found here:
